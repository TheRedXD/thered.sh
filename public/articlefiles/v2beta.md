# TheRed.SH v2 beta is out!

Hello everyone! So, a few years later, after the weirdly-named "beta 2 alpha 2" version of thered.sh came out, and then... a LOT of silence...
<br>
<br>
*\*drum roll\**
<br>
<br>
## v2 is finally here!

The v2 version is a complete rewrite of the website in Vite+Vue, and it is absolutely amazing. There are still some things to polish (which is why this is marked as "beta"), but it's good enough that it's alright to release publicly. You'll see a lot more stuff soon!

There are a lot of plans for v2, including but not limited to:
- Built-in comments system in articles
- Accounts
- Live chat instead of a feedback system you don't see the response from
- Reimplement a lot of the components in the new Markdown-based article system that we had in the Next.js component-based article system.
- Add thumbnails for my projects
- Integrate a visualization building system using three.js (including the ability to build games o-o)
- Various bugfixes and organizational changes
- Port over all of the old articles to the new system
- And a lot more!

There's a lot of work to be done. So far, it's looking pretty good!

Can't wait to hear what you all think of this new website!
